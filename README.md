# Sales Forecasting
The sales forecasting project involves the development of a machine learning model to predict sales. The process begins with data cleaning, where raw data is processed to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Next, data exploration techniques are employed to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics, such as distributions, correlations, and trends.

Following data cleaning and exploration, the project moves on to feature engineering, where relevant features are selected or created to improve model performance. Hyperparameter tuning is then performed to optimize the model's parameters, often using techniques like grid search or randomized search.

Once the model is trained and tuned, it is evaluated using appropriate metrics to assess its performance. This evaluation helps in identifying potential areas for improvement and fine-tuning the model further.

Throughout the project, best practices in machine learning are followed, including cross-validation to ensure robustness, and model interpretation techniques to understand the factors driving the sales predictions.

Overall, the sales forecasting project is a comprehensive endeavor involving data preprocessing, exploration, model development, and evaluation to create an accurate and reliable predictive model for sales forecasting.
